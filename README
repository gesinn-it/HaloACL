# Hallo everybody
===============

You can download HaloACL for _SMW 2.0_ and _MW 1.22.X_ and _1.23.X_ here. 

Please make sure to have a backup before downloading and setting up this extension. Treat this extension like a product in open beta at first. 

If you find any flaws, errors or unprotected content, although it should be protected, please let me know. The easiest way is to do so, is to open an issue. 

I'd be glad if you want to contribute. So feel free, to add or change the code!

NOTE: There may be issues with any other extension. If so, you can alert me or try to fix it by yourself.

Regards,
Wojtek
