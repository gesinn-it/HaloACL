Hallo everybody.

You can download HaloACL for SMW2.0 and MW 1.22.X and 1.23.X here. The missing patchfiles for all X versions will follow. 

Please make sure to have a backup before downloading and setting up this extension. Treat this extension like a product in open beta at first. 

If you find any flaws, errors or unprotected content, although it should be protected, please let me know. The easiest way is to do so, is to open an issue. 

I'd be glad if you want to contribute. So feel free, to add or change the code!

Regards,
Wojtek
